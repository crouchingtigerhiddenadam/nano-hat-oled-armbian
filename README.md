## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Enable i2c0:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install armbian-config
sudo armbian config
```
Select `System`, `Hardware`, mark `i2c0` and `Save`. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

### Dependencies
Install the dependences from APT:
```
sudo apt -y install \
  libjpeg-dev \
  libfreetype6-dev \
  git \
  python3 \
  python3-dev \
  python3-pip \
  python3-setuptools \
  python3-smbus \
  python3-wheel \
  ttf-dejavu \
  zlib1g-dev \
  python3-libgpiod
```
And install `image` and `pillow` from PIP:
```
sudo pip3 install \
  image \
  pillow
```
### Get the Code
Clone from GitHub:
```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/crouchingtigerhiddenadam/nano-hat-oled-armbian
```

Run the code (optional):
```
cd /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian
python3 oled-start3.py
```
Use `ctrl+c` to terminate.

### Install
Make the program directory:
```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/nanohatoled
```
Copy the program files:
```
sudo mv /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian/oled-start3.py /usr/share/nanohatoled/
sudo cp /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian/splash.png /usr/share/nanohatoled/
```
Copy service file:
```
sudo mv nanohatoled.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable nanohatoled.service
```
Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo reboot now
```

## Upgrade from Previous Versions
Get the latest code:
```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/crouchingtigerhiddenadam/nano-hat-oled-armbian
```
Compile the code:
```
cd /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian
python3 -O -m py_compile oled-start3.py
```
Remove files from the previous version:
```
sudo rm /usr/share/nanohatoled/* -r
```
Copy the lastest version into place:
```
sudo mv /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian/oled-start3.py /usr/share/nanohatoled/
sudo mv /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian/splash.png /usr/share/nanohatoled/
```
Edit `rc.local`:
```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Then find the line:
```
exit 0
```
If required, change `cd /usr/share/nanohatoled & /usr/bin/nice /usr/bin/python -n 10 oled-start.pyo &` before `exit 0` so the lines look like this:
```
cd /usr/share/nanohatoled && /usr/bin/nice -n 10 /usr/bin/python3 oled-start3.py &
exit 0
```
Save these changes by pressing `ctrl+x`, `ctrl+y` and `enter` as prompted at the bottom of the screen.   
  
Compile the code:
```
cd /tmp/nano-hat-oled-armbian
python3 -O -m py_compile oled-start3.py
```
Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo reboot now
```

## Troubleshooting

### Compatibility with BakeBit and NanoHatOLED
This does not require the FriendlyARM BakeBit or NanoHatOLED software to be installed. If this has already been installed you will need disable it.
```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Then find the lines:
```
/usr/local/bin/oled-start
exit 0
```
And comment out the `oled-start` line by adding `#` at the start of the line, so the lines look like this:
```
# /usr/local/bin/oled-start
exit 0
```
Save these changes by pressing `ctrl+x`, `ctrl+y` and `enter` as prompted at the bottom of the screen.   
   
Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
```
sudo reboot now
```

## Appendix

### Enable i2c0 through /boot/armbianEnv.txt
```
sudo nano /boot/armbianEnv.txt
```
Add `i2c0` to the `overlays=` line, for example if the line appears as follows:
```
overlays=usbhost1 usbhost2
```
Then add `i2c0` with a space seperating it from the other values:
```
overlays=i2c0 usbhost1 usbhost2
```
Save these changes by pressing `ctrl+x`, `ctrl+y` and `enter` as prompted at the bottom of the screen.  
    
Reboot the system for the changes to take effect:
```
sudo reboot now
```

### Experimental Quick Install and Update
   
Enable the i2c0 either using `armbian-config` or changing `/boot/armbianEnv.txt` and reboot.   
   
After reboot, run the following command:
```
sudo wget -O - \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crouchingtigerhiddenadam/nano-hat-oled-armbian/primary/install3.sh | \
  sudo bash -
```
The command can be used to make a fresh installation or update an existing installation to the latest version.
   
Reboot the system for the changes to take effect:
```
sudo reboot now
```
